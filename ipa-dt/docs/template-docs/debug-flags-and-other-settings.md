## Script Cache Expiration

Script execution results will be saved in the cache, for a default duration (currently 10 minutes). In order to override this default duration, you can open the developer tools â†’ Application. In there you will find the session storage. To change the duration, add a key to the storage, called 'scriptExpirationMinutes', and give it the value you wish to set as the new duration.
