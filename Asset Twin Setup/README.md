# Asset Twin Setup

The Asset Twin Setup provides all the scripts and configurations you need to create an Asset Twin on Twinit. Here you find everything you need to create an example Asset Twin using a sample model and asset data. You will also find the documentation you need to be able to repurpose and reuse the example to create your Asset Twins.

## Creating an Example Asset Twin

Creating an example Asset Twin is as easy as :

1. Cloning this repository
2. Updating a Configuration excel workbook
3. Creating a new Twinit project
4. And running a setup script!

Step by step instructions and details are included in [this document](docs/example_asset_twin)

## Additional UI Navigator Component

The Asset Twin configuration includes configuration for displaying an ipa-core pageComponent using the IafViewer for the 3D/2D building model. To use this component you will need to add it to your ipa-core application as described [here](../Asset%20Twin%20Components/Readme.md).
